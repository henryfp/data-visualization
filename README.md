# Data Visualization

A data visualization project using D3.js. I created this project to learn more about D3.js and to play around with different graphs on my own time. I'll continue adding to it, but right now it contains a horizontal bar graph, a bubble chart, a donut chart (that transitions between different data) and a pie chart (that also transitions between different data). If you're having trouble creating any of these graphs, perhaps looking through this project can help!

## Getting Started

Each graph has it's own .js file named with what type of graph it is. The data for each graph is included in its file. The html has divs with ID's matching the type of graph.

Example: pieChart.js includes code for the pie chart and the data it uses. In the html, it appears in a div with the ID #pie.
